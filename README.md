React Practice Applications has a small list of applications that are built using React.


## Basic Installations

Before you run your project please ensure that you have the following.

 1. React
 2. Moment.js


## QuickStart

The main goal of the application is to let users have a way to write simple notes and store them. Once they are completed with the note, they can 
easily just click on the note and the note becomes deleted.

## Architecture

The architecture is simply based on React js with no backend support. No data is stored or saved either.


## Questions or Help

We are committed to a loosely-coupled architecture and would love to assist you in the usage of the application itself. If you would like to request features or support please email the team.
